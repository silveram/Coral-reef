          <p>Coral reefs are estimated to cover 284,300 <abbr title="Square kilometre">km2<abbr> (109,800 sq mi),[52] just under 0.1% of the oceans' surface area. The Indo-Pacific region (including the Red Sea, Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia and the Pacific) account for 91.9% of this total. Southeast Asia accounts for 32.3% of that figure, while the Pacific including Australia accounts for 40.8%. Atlantic and Caribbean coral reefs account for 7.6%.[4]</p>
          <p>Although corals exist both in temperate and tropical waters, shallow-water reefs form only in a zone extending from approximately 30° N to 30° S of the equator. Tropical corals do not grow at depths of over 50 meters (160 ft). The optimum temperature for most coral reefs is 26–27 °C (79–81 °F), and few reefs exist in waters below 18 °C (64 °F).[53] However, reefs in the Persian Gulf have adapted to temperatures of 13 °C (55 °F) in winter and 38 °C (100 °F) in summer.[54] 37 species of scleractinian corals inhabit such an environment around Larak Island.[55]</p>
          <p>Deep-water coral inhabits greater depths and colder temperatures at much higher latitudes, as far north as Norway.[56] Although deep water corals can form reefs, little is known about them. </p>
          <p>Coral reefs are rare along the west coasts of the Americas and Africa, due primarily to upwelling and strong cold coastal currents that reduce water temperatures in these areas (the Peru, Benguela and Canary Currents respectively).[57] Corals are seldom found along the coastline of South Asia—from the eastern tip of India (Chennai) to the Bangladesh and Myanmar borders[4]—as well as along the coasts of northeastern South America and Bangladesh, due to the freshwater release from the Amazon and Ganges Rivers respectively. </p>

            <li>The Great Barrier Reef—largest, comprising over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,600 kilometers (1,600 mi) off Queensland, <span id="location" class="country">Australia<span></li>
            <li>The Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System—second largest, stretching 1,000 kilometers (620 mi) from Isla Contoy at the tip of the Yucatán Peninsula down to the Bay Islands of Honduras</li>
            <li>The New Caledonia Barrier Reef—second longest double barrier reef, covering 1,500 kilometers (930 mi)</li>
            <li>The Andros, Bahamas Barrier Reef—third largest, following the east coast of Andros Island, Bahamas, between Andros and Nassau</li>
            <li>The Red Sea—includes 6,000-year-old fringing reefs located along a 2,000 km (1,240 mi) coastline</li>
            <li>The Florida Reef Tract—largest continental US reef and the third-largest coral barrier reef, extends from Soldier Key, located in Biscayne Bay, to the Dry Tortugas in the Gulf of Mexico[58]</li>
            <li>Pulley Ridge—deepest photosynthetic coral reef, Florida</li>
            <li>Numerous reefs around the Maldives</li>
            <li>The Philippines coral reef area, the second-largest in Southeast Asia, is estimated at 26,000 square kilometers. 915 reef fish species and more than 400 scleractinian coral species, 12 of which are endemic are found there.</li>
            <li>The Raja Ampat Islands in Indonesia's West Papua province offer the highest known marine diversity.[59]</li>
            <li>Bermuda is known for its northernmost coral reef system, located at 32.4°N 64.8°W. The presence of coral reefs at this high latitude is due to the proximity of the Gulf Stream. Bermuda coral species represent a subset of those found in the greater Caribbean.[60]</li>
            <li>The world's northernmost individual coral reef is located within a bay of Japan's Tsushima Island in the Korea Strait.[61]</li>
            <li>The world's southernmost coral reef is at Lord Howe Island, in the Pacific Ocean off the east coast of Australia.</li>
